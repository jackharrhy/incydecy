i lost the persistence to this at one point in time, in a version that was written using redis, `./scrape` was me rebuilding the data directly from the server this was used with by going through all messages, finding any thing++ / thing-- i wanted to keep, and was also the basis for the new sqlite schema that the main rust bot now uses.
